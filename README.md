# Genetic-Algorithms
A genetic algorithm which uses roulette wheel selection for the selection of parents operator,
uniform crossover for the crossover operator and random mutation for the mutation operator.

To use the project to apply the genetic algorithm to any objective function 
Build and define an objective function in a matlab .m file.
In app2D script alter the mFunction2D with any objective function name. 
Run the app2D script to start the genetic genetic algorithm.
